# ✈️ NASA Jet Engine RUL Predictor (XGBoost & Random Forest)

This project predicts the **Remaining Useful Life (RUL)** of turbofan jet engines using the NASA C-MAPSS dataset. It achieves an RMSE of **22.86** using a physics-guided XGBoost approach focused on just two critical sensors: **T50** (LPT Outlet Temp) and **Ps30** (HPC Outlet Pressure).

The project also includes a **Random Forest** implementation for comparison (RMSE 23.78), allowing users to benchmark the "Boosting" vs "Bagging" strategies directly.

## 📊 Key Features
* **Physics-Aware:** Tracks specific degradation signatures in Temperature and Pressure.
* **Velocity Detection:** Uses sensor *slope* (rate of change) to detect the specific moment degradation begins (The "Knee" point).
* **Dual Models:**
    * **XGBoost (Main):** Uses Gradient Boosting for superior accuracy (**RMSE 22.86**).
    * **Random Forest (Baseline):** Uses Bagging for robust stability (**RMSE 23.78**).
* **Interactive Dashboard:** Streamlit app for real-time engine diagnostics.

## ⚠️ Important Note on Results
Both training scripts (`train_xgboost.py` and `train.py`) generate the submission file named **`final_predictions_RMSE.txt`**.
* Running **XGBoost** overwrites this file with XGBoost predictions.
* Running **Random Forest** overwrites this file with Random Forest predictions.
* **Always check which script you ran last before using the results file.**

## 🚀 How to Run

### Option A: Run XGBoost (Recommended)
1.  **Train the Model:**
    ```bash
    python train.py
    python train_xgboost.py
    ```
2.  **Launch Dashboard:**
    ```bash
    streamlit run app_xgb.py
    ```
If you on only want to run the **Random Forest** then just
   ```bash
   python train.py
   streamlit run app.py
