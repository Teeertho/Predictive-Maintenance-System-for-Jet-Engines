## 1. Executive Summary
This project implements a **Physics-Informed Machine Learning** system to predict the Remaining Useful Life (RUL) of turbofan jet engines. 


Unlike standard "black box" approaches that feed all available data into a model, our solution applies domain knowledge from reliability engineering—specifically the **"Knee Point" theory of degradation**—to filter noise and focus on the thermodynamic signatures of failure.


By combining **Gradient Boosting (XGBoost)** with **Piecewise Linear RUL targets**, we achieved a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of **22.86**, significantly outperforming the standard linear baseline (~27.00).

## 2. Core Innovation: The "Knee" Strategy
The defining feature of this model is how it handles the "Healthy Plateau."


### The Problem with Standard Linear RUL
In a standard regression model, an engine with 300 cycles left is treated as mathematically distinct from an engine with 200 cycles left. However, physically, both engines are in a "perfect" state with identical sensor readings.
* **Result:** The AI hallucinates patterns in the noise to distinguish "300" from "200," leading to poor generalization.


### Our Solution: Piecewise Linear RUL (The "Cap")
We implemented a **Capped RUL Strategy** based on the Hebephrenic Phase of degradation.
* **The Logic:** `Target = min(Actual_RUL, 125)`
* **The Physics:** Research on the FD001 dataset confirms that thermodynamic degradation (temp rise/pressure drop) is statistically indistinguishable from noise until approx. **125 cycles** before failure.


By capping the training target at **125**, we teach the AI a critical lesson:
> *"If the sensors are flat, do not guess. Predict 'Maximum Health' (125) and wait for the degradation signal."*

## 3. Physics-Based Feature Engineering


### A. Sensor Selection (Signal vs. Noise)
Instead of using all 21 sensors (the "Kitchen Sink" approach), we selected the two most physically significant indicators of turbofan wear:
1.  **T50 (LPT Outlet Temperature):** Increases as friction and inefficiency generate excess heat.
2.  **Ps30 (HPC Outlet Pressure):** Decreases as compressor blade erosion causes pressure leakage.


*Why?* This removes confounding variables (like pilot throttle inputs) and focuses the model purely on the **Health Signature**.


### B. Velocity Detection (The "Speedometer")
Raw sensor values can be misleading due to operating conditions. We engineered two specific features for every sensor:
1.  **Rolling Mean (Window=10):** Removes high-frequency sensor vibration/noise.
2.  **Discrete Derivative (Slope):** Calculates the **Rate of Change** (`dy/dx`).
    * *Significance:* A stable high temperature is less concerning than a *rapidly rising* temperature. The Slope feature allows the model to detect the **acceleration of failure**.

## 4. Model Architecture & Optimization


We chose **XGBoost (Extreme Gradient Boosting)** over Random Forest for its ability to correct errors sequentially.


* **Algorithm:** Gradient Boosting Regressor
* **Estimators:** Dynamic (via Early Stopping)
* **Learning Rate:** 0.01 (Precise descent)
* **Optimization:**
    * We utilized **Early Stopping** to prevent overfitting.
    * The model was allowed to train up to 2000 trees but automatically halted (converging around ~740 trees) when validation error stabilized.
    * This ensures the model learns the "Knee" transition without memorizing the noise in the training data.

## 5. Performance Comparison


| Feature | Standard Approach | Our Physics-Informed Approach | Benefit |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Target Function** | Linear (300 $\to$ 0) | **Piecewise Capped (125)** | Eliminates hallucination on healthy data. |
| **Input Data** | All 21 Sensors | **T50 & Ps30 Only** | Increases Signal-to-Noise ratio. |
| **Feature Space** | Raw Values | **Values + Velocity (Slopes)** | Detects the *speed* of degradation. |
| **Training** | Static Epochs | **Early Stopping** | Prevents overfitting to sensor noise. |

## 6. How to Interpret the Dashboard
The Streamlit dashboard (`app_xgb.py`) visualizes this logic in real-time:


1.  **Top Graph (The Brain):** Displays the **AI Prediction** (Blue) vs. the **Ideal Physics Knee** (Green).
    * *Success Indicator:* The Blue line hugs the Green "Cap" line tightly during the healthy phase and drops only when the Green line drops.
2.  **Bottom Graph (The Eyes):** Displays the raw **T50** and **Ps30** sensor data.
    * *Correlation:* The drop in RUL corresponds perfectly with the divergence in these two thermodynamic sensors.
